# PRIAS to OMOP CDM v6

![](index_files/image1.png)

## Introduction
Active surveillance of early prostate cancer.

PRIAS is an observational study, following 8000 men with prostate cancer at about 70 sites worldwide.
The data is collected by clinicians or data managers via an online portal. This data collection is still ongoing.
More information can be found at [https://www.prias-project.org/](https://www.prias-project.org/).

People included in the PRIAS study have a histologically proven adenomcarcinoma of the prostate, and are not being
treated at the moment as the tumor is not aggresive. The full inclusiona and exclusion criteria can be found here:
[https://www.prias-project.org/modules/articles/article.php?id=1](https://www.prias-project.org/modules/articles/article.php?id=1).

All the study data is recorded in three tables:
- **Basedata**. One record per person with all clinical attributes (~60) at study start
- **Fulong**. One record per follow up visit. Mostly the same clinical attributes as base data.
- **Enddata**. One record for each person that discontinued the study.

The fields for each table is listed in the [Source Appendix](source_appendix.md).
